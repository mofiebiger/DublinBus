# Dublin Bus Project Team 1: The Bold Toads

## Project specifications

## Branching Guide

All development should take place on the dev branch.
When working on a piece of code create a branch from the dev branch and only merge back to the dev branch. 

Create branch:

```
git branch "branch name"
```

Merge branch back to dev

````

```

As a group we can review the dev code before commiting to master.
